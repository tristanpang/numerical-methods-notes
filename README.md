# Numerical Methods Notes

These notes are based on the Oxford Numerical Methods course taught by David Marshall (2023 for the NERC DTP) with additional information from LeVeque.

These are rough notes only. A polished version may or may not be completed. Please direct all typos to me. The GitHub repo contains LaTeX source, Python scripts for figures, and other useful Python things.
